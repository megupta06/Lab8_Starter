Graceful degradation and service workers are related through their shared goal of improving user experience under varying conditions. Graceful degradation ensures that an application continues to function with reduced capabilities when certain features are not available — for example, older browsers or poor network conditions. Service workers support this by enabling offline functionality, caching essential assets, and allowing fallback responses when the network fails. If a user loses internet connection, the service worker ensures the app still behaves reasonably, providing a degraded but usable experience — the core idea of graceful degradation.
